# Federation Authorization List

This repository contains the **list of Roblox game IDs** that are authorized to use the Federation Anticheat script.  
If you don’t trust our script — we don’t care. This project is strictly for developers who want to integrate Federation Anticheat into their games.

> **Trust Policy**  
> We do not provide guarantees or support for games outside the authorization list.  
> If you don’t trust the script, that’s fine.

## 🔧 How It Works
- Federation Anticheat checks the **Place ID** of the running game.  
- If the ID matches one in this list, the script runs normally.  
- If not, the script will refuse to execute.
